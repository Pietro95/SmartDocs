* The project is based on a [Firebase](https://smartdocs.firebaseio.com) database that collects all patients' data.</br>
* The patient can add to his own database datas like weigth and blood pressure, and his symptoms with a simple Android app.</br>
* On the other side the doctor can manage his patients' data </br>

### Backend
Our smart backend help doctor's work. Indeed it manage Firebase's data and it alerts the doctor if the patient has got dangerous symptoms. It also elaborates data in order to simplify doctor's work. For example our system calculates some data's average (like weight) and it detects if it is nomal or dangerous.
